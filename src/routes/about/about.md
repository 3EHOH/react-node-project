Hi! Welcome to my site.

I am a full-stack software engineer, an avid reader, and a hobby artist.

<b>Software:</b>

I enjoy working on big data projects that support data scientists. On the server-side, I use technologies as Scala, Postgresql, and Amazon S3, and on the client-side I like JavaScript ES6, Angular, Webpack, Lodash, and many more popular libraries.

Toss 'em all in Docker containers, and we're really cooking.

I also have experience with Node, React, Meteor, Nginx, and I am dual-certified
by MongoDB as a developer and database administrator.

Besides writing the code, I enjoy communicating with the users of that code, and collaborating with others on how to improve it.

my passion for software on LinkedIn</a>.

<b>Reading:</b>

I am a big fan of Russian literature. When I was an undergraduate, UCLA <a href="http://international.ucla.edu/cwl/slavicjournal/920">published an academic paper I wrote</a> about 20th century Russian fiction.

Now, I am diving into French postmodernists, such as Jean Baudrillard and Guy DeBord, whose work anticipated a lot of the interesting ethical questions we encounter in software today.

<b>Art:</b>

I work with a number of traditional media, including photography, spray paint, oil paint, and less traditional ones, like polyurethane foam, found objects, and joint compound.
